# Web-Scrapped-Songs-For-Spotify

This is a program I made using spotipy and the spotify API, it basically takes the date you enter at the beginning and it searches for the top 100 songs from that time,
scrapped from the billboard 100 website and then it compiles a playlist using the data it gathers on spotify
